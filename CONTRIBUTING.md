When adding new items, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Search previous resources before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- The description usually should not include "for Statamic", as everything on the list would have that.
- Check your spelling and grammar. This is your chance to demonstrate your knowledge of the difference between "there, their, and they're".
- The pull request should include a link to the resource and why it should be included.

Thank you for your suggestions!
